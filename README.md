# Super Mario Implementation in Python (NOW WITH TOUCH SCREEN CONTROLS)

The touch screen controls update is for Alanson Sample's EECS 598 class. We integrated 3 gestures with this existing Super Mario repo as a way to control the game. Touchscreen updates by Cole Hudson, Cameron Davis, and Brian Oo. The original super mario github project we leveraged is https://github.com/mx0c/super-mario-python

This is inspired by Meth-Meth-Method's [super mario game](https://github.com/meth-meth-method/super-mario/)
